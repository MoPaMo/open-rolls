# openRolls

This project aims to create a FOSS DnD character builder, as well as an open standard for DnD character sheets as structured data ([see the schema here](https://github.com/MoPaMo/open-rolls/blob/main/schema/character.json)). The idea is to break DnD Beyond's monopoly!

Features:
- 🔨  Character Builder / Wizard
- 📋  Character Sheet
- 🗃️  Export as JSON
- 💽  Persistent in LocalStorage
- 🚚  Import/export (WIP)
- 🪄  Automatic proficiencies + spells based on race/class (WIP)
- 🎲  Dice simulator (WIP)
