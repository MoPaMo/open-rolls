# openRolls

This project aims to create a FOSS DnD character builder, as well as an open standard for DnD character sheets as structured data ([see the schema here](https://github.com/MoPaMo/open-rolls/blob/main/schema/character.json))

For now, it features a character builder with a wizard that walks users through all the steps.
